# Contributing to Yuvomi

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Yuvomi is a small, opinionated project with deliberate architectural constraints. This guide covers what you need to know before submitting code.

---

## Hard Constraints

**Yuvomi enforces a strict "no frameworks, no build tools" policy.** This is a permanent architectural decision, not a temporary limitation.

Specifically - the following will **not** be merged:

- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.)
- Bundlers or transpilers (Webpack, Vite, Rollup, esbuild, TypeScript, etc.)
- CSS libraries (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
- External frontend dependencies at runtime - no CDN loads, no npm frontend packages. Third-party frontend code is allowed only as hand-copied, committed vendoring under `public/vendor/` (currently PDF.js, SortableJS, libphonenumber - plus Lucide at `public/lucide.min.js`); each vendored package ships its license and a README with update steps

Backend dependencies are evaluated case-by-case but must remain minimal. When in doubt, open an issue before writing code.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22 (required for `--experimental-sqlite` in tests)
- Git

### Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ulsklyc/yuvomi.git
cd yuvomi
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Set SESSION_SECRET - and CLEAR the prefilled DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY line
# (empty key = unencrypted dev DB; the placeholder would encrypt it with a
# publicly known string)
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts the server with `--watch` for automatic restarts on file changes.
The app answers on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). On the first visit it
guides you through creating the admin account in the browser; headless setups can run
`npm run setup` instead.

### Running tests

```bash
npm test              # All suites
```

Individual suites (faster during development):

```bash
npm run test:db
npm run test:tasks
npm run test:shopping
npm run test:meals
npm run test:calendar
npm run test:ncb            # notes, contacts, budget
npm run test:reminders
npm run test:notifications    # Web Push and external notification channels
npm run test:dashboard
npm run test:screensaver
npm run test:api
npm run test:ics-parser
npm run test:ics-sub
npm run test:modal-utils
npm run test:ux-utils
npm run test:kitchen-tabs
npm run test:setup
npm run test:multi-assignment
npm run test:caldav
npm run test:carddav
npm run test:split-expenses
npm run test:backup-scheduler
npm run test:housekeeping
npm run test:mobile-scroll-layout
npm run test:frontend-audit
npm run test:docker-publish
```

This is a representative selection - run `npm run` to see the full list of suites.
Which suite guards which invariant is catalogued in [docs/test-suites.md](docs/test-suites.md).

Tests run with plain Node and in-memory SQLite (`--experimental-sqlite`) - newer suites
use the built-in `node --test` runner, older ones are plain assertion scripts. No running
server or database required; tests import route handlers directly.

## Project Structure

Understanding where things live helps you find the right place for your changes:

```
server/
  index.js             # Express entry point, middleware chain
  db.js                # SQLite connection + migration runner (append-only)
  auth.js              # Session auth + user management
  routes/              # API route handlers - one file per module
  services/            # Business logic (calendar sync, recurrence engine)
public/
  index.html           # SPA shell (single entry point)
  router.js            # Client-side History API router
  api.js               # Fetch wrapper (auth, CSRF, error handling)
  styles/
    tokens.css         # Design tokens - all colors, radii, shadows, fonts
  components/          # Reusable Web Components (yuvomi-* prefix)
  pages/               # Page modules - each exports a render() function
  sw.js                # Service worker
  offline.html         # Offline fallback page (served by service worker)
test/                  # One test file per module (test-[module].js)
docs/                  # Product spec, screenshots
```

**Key patterns:**

- Every API route lives in `server/routes/` and follows the same `try/catch` → JSON response pattern
- Every frontend page is an ES module in `public/pages/` that exports `render()`
- All design values come from `tokens.css` - never hardcode colors, radii, or shadows
- Database migrations are appended to the `MIGRATIONS` array in `server/db.js` - never modify existing entries

## Workflow

### 1. Find or create an issue

Before starting work, check the [existing issues](https://github.com/ulsklyc/yuvomi/issues). For anything beyond a trivial fix, open an issue first to discuss the approach. This avoids wasted effort on changes that conflict with the project's direction.

### 2. Fork and branch

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/yuvomi.git
cd yuvomi
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ulsklyc/yuvomi.git
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming:**

| Prefix | Use for | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feat/` | New features | `feat/csv-import-budget` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/calendar-sync-timezone` |
| `refactor/` | Internal changes (no behavior change) | `refactor/extract-date-utils` |
| `docs/` | Documentation only | `docs/improve-setup-guide` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, CI, dependencies | `chore/update-helmet` |

### 3. Keep your fork in sync

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Rebase before opening a PR and keep the branch conflict-free.

### 4. Commit

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style` (formatting, not CSS)

**Scope:** The module or area affected - `tasks`, `shopping`, `meals`, `calendar`, `budget`, `notes`, `contacts`, `health`, `documents`, `auth`, `db`, `ui`, `pwa`

**Examples:**

```
feat(meals): add drag & drop between day slots
fix(calendar): handle timezone offset in recurring events
docs(readme): add Apple CalDAV setup instructions
refactor(auth): extract session validation into middleware
test(budget): add CSV export edge cases
chore: update helmet to 8.3
```

**Rules:**

- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 characters
- Body (optional): explain *why*, not *what* - the diff shows the what
- One logical change per commit - don't mix features with formatting

### 5. Open a pull request

- Target branch: `main`
- Title: follows the same Conventional Commits format as your commits
- Description: explain what the PR does, why, and link the related issue (`Closes #123`)
- Keep PRs focused - one feature or fix per PR

**Before opening:**

```bash
npm test              # All tests pass
```

### 6. Review and merge

PRs are reviewed by the maintainer. Expect feedback within a few days. Same-repo PRs
additionally get an automated AI review comment (Claude Code) shortly after opening, and
mentioning `@claude` in an issue or PR comment triggers an AI assistant. Their findings are
informational; the maintainer's review decides. PRs from forks are excluded from the
automation. Once approved, PRs are merged by the maintainer, usually squashed into a
single commit.

**A red `claude-review` check is not a review finding.** Open the job and read which step
failed first - the job goes red for ordinary reasons too (checkout, the action itself, a
GitHub API call), and only one specific failure is about the review staying silent.

That one is the step **"Die Review muss gesprochen haben"**. It exists because for five PRs
the check was green over a review that never happened. Its message names the two known
causes; the second needs the job log, where `permission_denials_count` tells you *how many*
tools were refused but not which - re-run with `show_full_output: true` to see the name.

**Do not add the tool in the PR that failed.** A PR touching
`.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` makes the action skip itself (it only runs when
the workflow matches the default branch) and makes this check stand aside, so it would turn
green without any review having run. Report the denied tool instead and let a maintainer add
it to `claude_args` on `main` - note that the list there **replaces** the review plugin's
own, so existing entries have to stay.

Once that has landed, **"Re-run jobs" on the old run will not pick it up.** A rerun replays
the same workflow file at the same commit, so it hits the same denial and looks like the fix
failed. The PR needs a fresh `pull_request` event to be evaluated against the new default
branch: push to it, or merge `main` into the branch, or close and reopen it.

One limit worth knowing: the check asks whether the PR carries *any* comment from the
reviewer, not whether *this run* produced one. That is deliberate - the plugin looks for its
own earlier comment and will not repeat itself on a later push - but it means a silent rerun
on a PR that was already reviewed stays green. The assertion covers "this PR was never
reviewed", not "every run reviewed it".

## Code Conventions

### General

- ES modules everywhere (`import`/`export`, never `require`)
- Semicolons: **yes**
- `try/catch` in every route handler - no unhandled promise rejections
- No dynamic code execution. Never write user data directly into an HTML string - use `esc()` from `public/utils/html.js` in template literals, or DOM API (`createElement`, `textContent`). Use `insertAdjacentHTML` to append HTML fragments, `replaceChildren()` to replace content. Direct `innerHTML` assignments are rejected by the frontend audit (`npm run test:frontend-audit`), which runs as part of `npm test`.
- Hyphens, not dashes: write `-`, never `—` or `–`. This holds for text people read rather than execute: the READMEs, the CHANGELOG, commit messages, UI strings and locale values. `npm run test:readme-consistency` enforces it for `README.md` and `README.de.md`; everywhere else it is on you. Existing code comments on `main` are inconsistent about this and are deliberately left alone, so `git grep` is not a reliable guide here.

### Frontend

- Web Component prefix: `yuvomi-` (one component per file)
- All UI text via i18n keys (`t('key')`) - never hardcode text in components. German (`de`) is the reference locale.
- **Adding a new i18n key:** add it to **all** files in `public/locales/` (24 languages; a
  non-German value may start as the English text). The JSON files are 4-space indented
  and nested - edit them in place, never reserialize a whole file. A key interpolating a
  numeric `count` needs an `_one` singular variant (`{{count}}` placeholder), otherwise
  the UI shows "1 Aufgaben". `npm run test:i18n` and `npm run test:i18n-plural` guard all
  of this and run in CI - a UI change without complete locales will not pass.
- Date format: `DD.MM.YYYY` - Time format: `HH:MM` (24h)
- CSS uses design tokens from `public/styles/tokens.css` - never hardcode values
- Pages export a `render()` function, no side effects on import

### Backend

- One route file per module in `server/routes/`
- API responses: `{ data: ... }` on success, `{ error: string, code: number }` on failure
- Database migrations: append to the `MIGRATIONS` array in `server/db.js` - **never modify existing entries**
- New entity tables: `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, `created_at TEXT`, `updated_at TEXT` (ISO 8601). Key/value and join tables (`sync_config`, `task_tags`, …) deviate deliberately
- Any server-side fetch of a URL stored from user/admin input (WebDAV targets, ICS feed URLs, subscription logos, recipe provider `base_url`s, ...) goes through `server/utils/ssrf.js` (`isBlockedAddress`/`createGuardedLookup`), not a bare `fetch()`. This is one classifier so DNS-rebinding and private-network edge cases aren't reimplemented per subsystem; `npm run test:ssrf` pins both the classification logic and which known modules actually call it, and runs as part of `npm test`.

### Testing

- One test file per module in the `test/` directory (`test/test-[module].js`)
- Tests use in-memory SQLite via `--experimental-sqlite`
- Import route handlers directly - no HTTP calls, no running server

---

## Changelog

User-facing changes should be reflected in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). If your PR adds a feature, fixes a bug, or changes behavior, add an entry under `[Unreleased]` in the appropriate category (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Security`).

**Every entry opens with a bolded sentence naming the change.** Prose about the reasoning is welcome underneath it - this file says *why* things were decided the way they were, and that is not written down anywhere else. But somebody who just updated wants to know what changed without reading three paragraphs to find out. The first line answers that; everything after it is for whoever wants the story.

```markdown
### Added
- **Budget entries can be imported from CSV.** The importer maps columns by
  header name rather than by position, because an export from a bank rarely
  puts them in the same order twice ...
```

`npm run test:changelog` enforces the bolded lead-in for `[Unreleased]` and every version from 2.41.0 on. Earlier entries are left as they are: a published changelog does not get rewritten.

Otherwise: user-oriented language, and `-` rather than `—` or `–`. An entry does not stay in this file - it ships as the GitHub release notes and feeds the app store listings.

## AI Assistance

Asked for in [#687](https://github.com/ulsklyc/yuvomi/discussions/687). Yuvomi holds a household's calendar, health notes, documents and finances, so it is fair to ask who - or what - wrote the code that handles them.

### How this project is built

**AI coding agents are used here, extensively and openly.** Much of the code in this repository was drafted with them. Two of them also review pull requests automatically, and you will see their comments on yours: a Claude Code workflow and an OpenAI Codex connector.

That is worth stating plainly rather than leaving to inference. An automated review comment on your PR is not a maintainer's verdict; it is a second pair of eyes with no authority to merge anything.

### What a human guarantees

**Nothing reaches `main` without a human deciding that it should.** Every merge in this repository is performed by the maintainer, including automated dependency updates and contributions from others. There is no path by which an agent merges its own work.

Beyond that decision, three things are mechanical and hold for every change regardless of who or what wrote it:

- The full test suite runs on every pull request, and a red build is not merged.
- The [Hard Constraints](#hard-constraints) above are enforced by tests, not by good intentions - a framework import or an `innerHTML` call fails the build.
- Behaviour that is claimed to be fixed carries a test that fails against the state before the fix. A guard that was never seen red is not evidence.

**On "a human has read and understood every merged line":** for a one-person project shipping several releases a week, that sentence would be a promise nobody could keep, and a promise that cannot be kept is worse than none - it invites exactly the trust it does not earn. What is true instead: the maintainer reviews every change before merging it, decides whether it goes in, and is answerable for it either way. Where a change touches something sensitive - authentication, permissions, storage, anything reaching the network - that review goes line by line.

### If you contribute

**Say so if an agent wrote it.** One line in the PR description is enough ("drafted with Claude Code", "Copilot-assisted"). It is not a mark against the contribution and it will not slow the review down.

The reason is practical rather than moral: it tells the reviewer where to look. Generated code fails in different places than hand-written code does - plausible-looking APIs that do not exist, tests that assert what the implementation happens to do rather than what it should, an edge case handled in the comment but not in the branch. Knowing to check for that is worth more than any policy about it.

What is expected of the contribution itself does not change: you understand what you are submitting, you can explain why it works, and you can answer questions about it in review. If you cannot, the tool you used is not the problem.
